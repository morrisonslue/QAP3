1. This assessment took approximately 8 hours
2. I used the code from class posted in GitHub, mostly https://devdocs.io/ for js, react and vite, and asked ChatGPT troubleshooting questions (I had a frustrating issue with the images resizing the form. ChatGPT was able to explain what was happening but ultimately I was able to just put the header and form in their own container with more consistent
width settings)
3. I did not speak with anyone about the assignment
4. N/A
5. I would rate the difficulty here as a 6.5 and feel I could solve a similar problem much easier now. I felt I spent the bulk of my time in devdocs for js and react on this assignment but could do it again much faster now.
